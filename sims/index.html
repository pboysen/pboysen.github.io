<h2>Meteorology Simulations</h2>
<p>You can use the following simulations to explore conditions relating to such challenging concepts as solar and terrestrial radiation, 
humidity variables, temperature lags and adiabatic processes.
Each simulation is written in HTML5 and Javascript and will run in most modern browsers including mobile.</p>

<h3>Mountain Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity allows the user to adjust the initial temperature and vapor pressure of a parcel, 
denoted by a leaf, to observe how saturation occurs as the parcel travels over the mountain. 
The challenge for the user is hypothesize how these parameters affect when (where) saturation occurs to identify the 
variety of paths to saturation.

<h3>Radiation Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>Users collect temperature profile data for day and night in an environment 
that differs only by surface conditions. This activity is intended to be a puzzle since users are not 
expected to have yet been exposed to course materials that explain the profile differences. 
The challenge for the users is to list both what makes sense and what doesn't.</p>

<h3>Budget Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity challenges the users to hypothesize how input and output flows 
affect the water level in the tank over time. The input flow can be changed during predetermined time periods. 
The output flow is constant during the entire activity. 
The goal is for the user to construct rules that govern tank water level and are generally applicable to parameters 
other than water.</p>

<h3>Advection Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity allows the user to modify the wind speed, direction, duration, isotherm spacing to observe the 
impact of these variables on advection and the temperature gradient moves.</p>

<h3>Vapor Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity introduces the user to the process of condensation and evaporation in a beaker.  
Users can apply heat to watch the system reach equilibrium.</p>

<h3>Bubble Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>This activity introduces the user to parcels of air that rise and fall in the atmosphere as the result of heating and cooling.</p>

<h3>Draw Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong>DrawSim lets students draw a variety of symbols on weather maps.  It is divided into three basic tools to let the student:
<ul>
<li>Pressure: wind vectors and pressure regions</li>
<li>Air Mass: place one of eight air mass symbols</li>
<li>IsoPath: draw lines connecting equal values</li>
</ul>
<p>An example pressure map is shown below.</p>
