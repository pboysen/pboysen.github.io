# prosemirror-widgets
A collection of widgets for use in the ProseMirror Editor [View Demo](https://pboysen.github.io)

In [ThinkSpace](http://www.thinkspace.org), 
faculty use CKEditor to build content in multiple pages called phases which are 
linked together forming a complex problem for students to solve. CKEditor is great but has typical HTML editor problems and takes work to add new widgets to insert. **Enter ProseMirror**.

We are investigating using ProseMirror to provide an HTML editor for instructors and for collaborative editing for student teams.
